     <p>The Ebola situation in Liberia overwhelmed local capacity to control it. At first the situation was not well understood, with many reporters believing that the situation was not as bad as the news presented.</p>
     <p>The situation degraded rapidly into a national emergency. Schools and offices were closed, hospitals were turning away suspected cases and the dead were abandoned in the streets..</p>
     <p>25 Liberian community organizations formed a coalition to bring information from the ground to public knowledge, including the use of TIMBY. The team also handed out Ebola kits (soap, buckets) and provided information about prevention to at-risk communities.</p>
