       <p>Our main partners developing TIMBY are the Sustainable Development Institute in Liberia, headed by Goldman Prize Winner Silas Siakor. The Sustainable Development Institute have worked with the development team every step of the way, helping design and test the application and platform over a period of two years.</p>
       <p>Now SDI are the biggest TIMBY users in the region, reporting on everything from palm oil to iron ore to county social development funds. Their systematic approach has spawned personal meetings with the President over palm oil concessions and the shut down of over 60 illegal forestry concessions. They have now started a legal aid wing.</p>
       <p>In partnership with TIMBY’s evidence-based reporting, the group will now be using the country’s legal systems to bring accountability to country’s resource industries. You can check out their stories here</p>

      <h1>Liberian Ebola Outbreak</h1>

     <div class="five columns">
       <p>The Ebola situation in Liberia has overwhelmed local capacity to control it. At first (a few weeks ago) the situation was not well understood, with many of our on-the-ground partners believing that the situation was not as bad as the news presented.</p>
       <p>However, in the last several weeks, the situation has degraded rapidly. Schools and offices are closed, hospitals are turning away suspected cases and the dead are being left abandoned in the streets. The country has called a national emergency and further fears are growing about human trials for various previously untested vaccines and medications.</p>
       <p>25 Liberian community organizations have formed a coalition to report on the Ebola situation using TIMBY, bringing information from the ground to public knowledge. The team is also handing out Ebola kits (soap, buckets) and providing information about prevention to at-risk communities. You can check out their stories here.</p>
