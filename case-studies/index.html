        <p>TIMBY-SDI is reporting on everything from palm oil to iron ore and social development funds over the last two years.</p>
        <p>Their systematic approach has spawned personal meetings with the President over palm oil concessions, the shut down of over 60 illegal forestry concessions and added transparency to millions of dollars of displaced social development funding for social projects.</p>
        <p>Armed with a budding legal aid wing, the group will now be using the country’s legal systems to bring accountability to country’s resource industries. <a href="">You can check out their stories here.</a></p>

     <p>The Ebola situation in Liberia overwhelmed local capacity to control it. At first the situation was not well understood, with many reporters believing that the situation was not as bad as the news presented.</p>
     <p>The situation degraded rapidly into a national emergency. Schools and offices were closed, hospitals were turning away suspected cases and the dead were abandoned in the streets..</p>
     <p>25 Liberian community organizations formed a coalition to bring information from the ground to public knowledge, including the use of TIMBY. The team also handed out Ebola kits (soap, buckets) and provided information about prevention to at-risk communities.</p>
