We pitched TIMBY (and it’s accompanying film project Logs of War (@logsofwar) at the [Good Pitch New York](https://goodpitch.org/events/gpny2014)!

We were ecstatic when Louis Bickford from the Ford Foundation stood up in the audience right after our pitch and announced they would like to contribute to the project.  We made a ton of wonderful connections in the fields of social justice/environmental film and technology projects.

We’re enormously grateful to Britdoc (the organizers), Ford and all the other amazing people we met that day!
