We presented TIMBY at [The Tribeca Film Institute’s Interactive Day](https://tribecafilminstitute.org/pages/2014_lineup), among a packed line-up of fantastic creators working at the interface of film and technology. Such a treat to be among these folks!

A quick shout-out to our fellow TFI grantees (and fantastic projects to look out for): [American Promise](https://tribecafilminstitute.org/films/detail/american_promise), [Chasing the Sun](https://tribecafilminstitute.org/films/detail/chasing_the_sun), [Action Switchboard](https://tribecafilminstitute.org/films/detail/the_yes_men_are_revolting) and [Who is Dayani Cristal?](https://tribecafilminstitute.org/films/detail/who_is_dayani_cristal).

We’re so thankful to Tribeca for getting behind the TIMBY vision from the start!
