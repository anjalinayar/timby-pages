     <p>We are a team of activists, journalists, designers and technologists living and working in Africa.  Here the same issues come up again and again in the news: land grabs, foreign companies, corruption and poor governance.</p>
     <p>We wanted to do something that dug beneath the headlines, the short-term stories that barely scratch the surface of the people and companies that offend over and over: from European arms traders to elected officials: the same names kept coming up again and again.</p>

     <p>At the root of it, one word came up again and again: accountability.</p>
     <p>We had been there once the companies had come and gone. But we wanted to tell the story as it happened. We started with a film project (link) and wanted to create a system where our teams could safely and securely report on what was happening around them. But to do this, it had to be useful to them, had to make a difference in their backyards.</p>
     <p>We teamed up with a group of activists working in a hotspot of these problems: Liberia. They had been taking photos during the country’s 14-year civil war, but most of those photos were now lost or forgotten. After a brief period of grace in the country, the problems started again. They started again.</p>
     <p>We worked side-by-side with them, attuning the platform for their needs, in terms of functionality and design.</p>
     <p>On the flip side we worked with journalists and NGOs and looked at what they wanted and needed to report on or push the agendas of these community groups.</p>

     <p>We developed the technology alternately in Nairobi and Liberia, with the entire group of stakeholders around the table. We’ve tested TIMBY in urban centers and areas so far off the beaten path, there’s no road, no power, no network. But there is a great big palm oil plantation.</p>
     <p>And we started seeing change. In the last year and a half, we’ve worked alongside our team to report on company fraud, and large-scale government cover-ups. We’ve gotten forestry companies shut down (over 60 of them) and got communities a meeting with the President to talk over land ownership.</p>
     <p>We’ve even started to collaborate with a legal aid program, to see how we can use TIMBY evidence in court and bring accountability to offenders.</p>
     <p>It’s a simple and easy-to-use, safe reporting system. And it’s starting to spread. We’ve got TIMBY partners in Nigeria, Liberia, Kenya and South Africa. But we want to make it even easier, so you don’t need a technologist to set you up. (link to case studies)</p>
     <p>Through TIMBY.org, you can download and install TIMBY for your team and start changing your backyard.</p>
